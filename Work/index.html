		<p class="AboutMeInfo">
			I'm 15 and I attend Kempner High School as a sophomore. People perceive me as being extrovert, but more than anything, I'm introvert.
			I play in the Kempner Marching band. I plan on staying the in band through my highschool year (4yrs). I enjoy a good challenge, because there is so much to learn from your imperfections. The littlest of things i can critique myself about makes a better person, and this may also apply to yourself also.
			I live with my family of 5. I care for everyone of them, helping and expressing how much I appreciate them. Even though it's through doing something harsh or something nice.
